# rack_parts
I'm posting the models I used for my 10" mini-rack project here. With two exceptions* these are all my own designs.


(* The optiplex/thinkcentre shelf is a remix of [a design found on onshape from user "salemz"](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/edc2be91c8a5c8ce739145d0/w/da46e5e176b4d39cc755736e/e/9c80555ae34e66083f173074). The 5.25" brackets are remixed from [this hardwarehaven model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6859441) and intended to be installed inside/over a deskpi 1U rack shelf for support.

The rack:

All panel designs conform to this very professional design doc:
