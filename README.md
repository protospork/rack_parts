# rack_parts
I'm posting the models I used for my 10" mini-rack project here. With two exceptions* these are all my own designs.


(* The optiplex/thinkcentre shelf is a remix of a design found on onshape. The blank vented panels are from thingiverse or something. Original uploaders will be credited when I find them.)
